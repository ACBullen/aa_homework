      <h2>Baked Tortelini</h2>
      <section>

      <p> Baked tortelini is a fairly modern spin on the classic dish of tortelini.
          The the tortelini is boiled as normal, but instead of just a classic sauce,
          such as a bechamel or light tomato sauce, we can build a kind of casserole
          around the pasta, with bacon and peas adding a little extra substance, and a
          crunchy topping made of bread crumbs and a bit of olive oil to add an extra
          textural layer to the dish.</p>

          <h2>Directions <a name="directions"/></h2>
          <ol>
            <li> Preheat oven to 350 degrees.</li>
            <li> Put tortelini into a pot of boiling water. Cook per package instructions and then reserve in the pot with a little olive oil to keep them from sticking together.</li>
            <li> combine olive oil and bread crumbs in a bowl and set aside.</li>
            <li> Add bacon to a pan on medium-high heat and cook until brown and crispy and a goood bit of fat has rendered off. Add shallots and cook until lightly caramelized.</li>
            <li> Add thyme and garlic and cook until fragrant.</li>
            <li> Add flour to pan and allow about a minute to brown. Then whisk in the cream and chicken broth (Go slowly and stir constantly, the goal is a smooth sauce). Give it a minute at a simmer to thicken.</li>
            <li> Add parmesan off the heat and salt and pepper to taste.</li>
            <li> Combine tortelini, finished sauce, and peas in a 9x9 baking dish. Cover with breadcrumb mixture and place in the oven until the sauce is bubbly and the topping is browned (~15 minutes depending on your oven and how spread out your topping is).</li>
            <li> Serve in bowls with a nice glass of wine!</li>
